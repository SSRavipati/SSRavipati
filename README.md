## Hi there I'm Sankari 👋


### Senior AI Systems Engineer | Full-Stack Architect | Quantitative Strategist

I specialize in architecting **enterprise-grade AI ecosystems** and **intelligent data pipelines**. My expertise lies in bridging the gap between raw data (Graph, Vector, Document) and actionable business intelligence using Large Language Models (LLMs). 

From designing **security-hardened RAG architectures** with Neo4j to building **high-concurrency document parsers**, I focus on building systems that are scalable, observable, and production-ready.

## 🌟 Featured Engineering Projects

### 🏗️ [GraphRAG: Production AI-Graph Integration](https://github.com/[your-username]/GraphRAG)
**Problem:** LLMs struggle with multi-hop reasoning and data hallucinations in complex schemas.  
**Solution:** A security-first Graph-backed RAG system that enables natural language querying of Neo4j knowledge graphs.
* **Key Innovation:** Implemented a **Dual-Pipeline Architecture**:
    * *Pipeline 1:* Automated Schema Extraction with SHA-256 fingerprinting for idempotent metadata management.
    * *Pipeline 2:* LLM-driven Intent Planning that converts natural language into validated, parameterized Cypher queries.
* **Production Features:** Redis-backed token bucket rate limiting, OpenTelemetry tracing, and semantic synonym mapping to handle varied user terminology.
* **Stack:** FastAPI, Neo4j, Redis, Google Gemini, Prometheus.

### 📄 [FormSight: Document Parser AI](https://github.com/[your-username]/FormSight)
**Problem:** Extracting structured data from high-variance documents (handwritten text, nested tables) is traditionally brittle.  
**Solution:** An intelligent Document Understanding prototype using a Vision-capable LLM backend.
* **Key Innovation:** Developed a React-based interactive verification UI where extracted JSON data is mapped back to the document via **normalized bounding box overlays**.
* **Security:** Engineered a secure backend proxy to prevent API key exposure in the frontend bundle.
* **Stack:** React, TypeScript, Node.js, pdf.js, Gemini 1.5 Flash.

### 🌐 [Multilingual NLI (XLM-RoBERTa)](https://github.com/[your-username]/Multilingual-MNLI)
**Scope:** Deep Learning & Research.
* Implemented a state-of-the-art Natural Language Inference model fine-tuned on **15 languages**.
* Utilized **XLM-RoBERTa** to achieve high-accuracy logical entailment across diverse linguistic structures.
* Managed large-scale training on **TPU infrastructure** using TensorFlow and Hugging Face.

### 📈 [Portfolio Risk & Optimization Engine](https://github.com/[your-username]/Portfolio-Optimization)
**Scope:** Quantitative Analytics.
* Built a robust financial model utilizing **Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)** to identify the **Efficient Frontier**.
* Engineered a Co-Variance Matrix to optimize asset allocation, successfully maximizing the Sharpe Ratio for multi-sector portfolios (BRK.B, NKE, TTE).
* **Stack:** Excel, VBA Automation, Quantitative Modeling.

## 📉 Engineering Philosophy

* **Fail-Closed Security:** I prioritize system integrity by implementing multi-layer validation (Input sanitization → Guardrail classification → Schema validation).
* **Observability First:** I build with the "Day 2" mindset, integrating Prometheus metrics and structured logging from the first commit.
* **Deterministic AI:** I believe AI should respect the schema. My work focuses on making LLM outputs predictable, verifiable, and cited.

## 🎯 Current Research & 2026 Goals

* **Agentic Workflows:** Developing multi-agent systems for autonomous "Check-and-Balance" data verification.
* **Performance Engineering:** Porting high-throughput data ingestion modules to **Rust** for superior memory safety and concurrency.
* **Knowledge Graphs:** Exploring the intersection of GNNs (Graph Neural Networks) and LLMs for predictive graph modeling.
